\section{Introduction}
The ZK-48 ignition (German "Z체ndkasten 48 Ausg채nge") system was developed, because of a lack of affordable  programmable firing systems. Therefore the development began for a low cost, yet reliable and robust device, that works in any condition. This document provides all information surrounding this project and anyone with basic knowledge in electronics should be able to rebuild it for them self. Although this should not be viewed as an instruction, on how to build this device, the author hopes it will be useful to a pyrotechnic and or electronics enthusiast. The finished device is shown in \Cref{fig:complete_with_trig_and_mod} with the trigger on the right and one ignition module on the left.

\subsection{Legal Disclaimer}
\textbf{Please check your local laws before you decide on building a system such as this, by your self! Some countries may have laws prohibiting the construction of home-made ignition systems. So get informed! The author of this document does not endorse illegal activities, nor can he be held responsible for any person's illegal activities. According to Austrian law, to which the author is subject, the construction and use of self-made ignition systems in the private and professional sphere is \textit{not} prohibited! This is not legal advice, so do your own research!}\\

\noindent \textbf{In this document electronic ignitable matches are sometimes refereed to as \textit{Bridge wire detonators} or also short \textit{detonators}. However, this does not mean actual detonators (also in English called \textit{blasting caps}) are used, as they contain high explosives which are not legal, without license, in Austria! The author refers to the in Austrian/German called "A-Typ Br체ckenz체nder"\footurl{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br\%C3\%BCckenz\%C3\%BCnder} which are legal to purchase by anyone who is over 18 years of age. Again, this is not legal advise and do proper research on your local laws!}

\subsection{Concept}
\label{Concept}
The device is divided into four subunits: controller, ignition voltage generator, trigger and ignition module, as seen in \Cref{fig:concept}. On board the controller, which sits in the middle, are all user input elements, sockets for connecting the peripheral devices and inside the controller are the circuits that coordinates everything. The trigger is connected by cable to the controller and is used to start the pre-programmed pyrotechnic show. There are six ignition modules, also connected to the controller by cable, and each module is able to ignite eight bridge wire detonators separately (A-Type Only).  Therefore the complete system is capable of setting of 48 detonators with 48 steps in the pyrotechnic show.

\noindent The system operates by the fire-and-forget principle. The user arms both the controller and the trigger and after pressing the trigger button the controller will automatically ignite the firework in the preprogrammed sequence. No user input is needed after starting the pyrotechnic show. When the trigger is pressed the system goes into a $10s$ delay phase, in order for the user to distance themselves from the device and get to safety, before the pyrotechnic effects are ignited. After the delay phase has ended, the ignition phase is entered, where the programmed sequence will play through until the predetermined endpoint is reached. The trigger could be replaced with a RF-trigger, although this is not recommend due safety and legal concerns in some countries. The delay phase also serves as a fail safe, because in the case of an accidental triggering of the system, the user is able to abort the start by disarming the system. During the ignition phase it is also possible to halt the program, by disarming the system, although re-triggering will repeat the delay phase.\\


\noindent As the device is most likely to be placed in an open-air field, there is no way for it to be connected to mains power, therefore it has to be operated by batteries. However, the usage of rechargeable batteries, such as LiPo-batteries, was not desirable for this project, due cost issues and the additional requirement of protection circuits. A better alternative was found by using common $5V$ portable powerbanks for smart phones. Those already provide steady $5V$ with build-in protective mechanisms. Furthermore, nowadays many people use powerbanks and if the user forgets to charge or forgets the powerbank altogether, there is a high probability some person will be able to provide one as replacement. A powerbank can be charged by a simple micro USB cable which is also very common and removes the need for a specialized charger.
